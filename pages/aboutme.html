                  During my time at the Scientific High School Galileo Ferraris (2017–2022), where I pursued the applied sciences curriculum, I built a solid foundation in mathematical analysis, chemistry, and computer science. It was here that my passion for computer science and programming took shape. I gained proficiency in creating flowcharts, and programming in C and Java, alongside learning the basics of SQL databases. Outside of formal education, I further enhanced my skills by exploring C#, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with a particular focus on game development.

                  I’m studying Computer and Software Systems Engineering at the Polytechnic University of Milan. I’ve developed expertise in advanced math, calculus, geometry, physics, and electronics, while refining my programming skills in C, Java, and learning RISC-V Assembly. I’ve also gained knowledge in Boolean logic, stochastic processes, algorithms, and core computer science principles. Additionally, I’ve built valuable soft skills in teamwork, leadership, critical thinking, emotional intelligence, and time management through various collaborative projects.

                In my free time, I enjoy working on personal projects, especially those involving coding and problem-solving. Whether it’s experimenting with new programming concepts, building small applications, or refining my skills, I find satisfaction in bringing ideas to life through technology. I also take part in competitions that challenge me to think critically and improve my abilities, whether they are coding contests or other skill-based challenges. These experiences push me to grow while also providing opportunities to connect with like-minded individuals.
                <br>
                <br>
                Beyond my technical interests, I enjoy engaging in social events where I can meet new people, exchange ideas, and gain fresh perspectives. I find that participating in different communities helps me expand my horizons and keeps things exciting. Another passion of mine is poetry—I appreciate how words can convey deep emotions and create vivid imagery. Writing or reading poetry is a way for me to express thoughts in a creative and meaningful way.
                <br>
                <br>
                Cooking is another activity I deeply enjoy. Experimenting with flavors, trying out new recipes, and crafting meals is both a creative and rewarding process. Just like coding, it requires precision, intuition, and a bit of experimentation to get things just right.
                <br>
                <br>
                Of course, I also appreciate various forms of entertainment, including movies, music, comics, and video games. These provide a great way to unwind, get inspired, and explore different stories and artistic expressions. Whether it's watching intriguing and thought-provoking films, listening to a powerful album, or diving into a captivating game and exploring intricate worlds, I love how entertainment can transport me to different worlds and perspectives.
                <br>
                <br>
                Overall, my free time is a blend of creativity, learning, and connection. Whether through coding, competitions, poetry, cooking, or entertainment, I enjoy engaging in activities that challenge me, inspire me, and bring a sense of fulfillment.
