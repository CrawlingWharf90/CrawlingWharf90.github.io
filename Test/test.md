    There's this dream. Something important. It's gone when I wake up. No time for dreams, I guess. The monster never dies no matter how many times you kill it.

One last time, then I can rest. —B.J.'s internal monologue on the truck ride

# Another Test Chapter



    "While I was gone, they set the world on fire. It wasn't war anymore; it was a remaking. Some losses are inevitable. Some...unthinkable. Now they've built a new world. Armies of steel and thunder. They're rewriting history. But they forgot about me."
    ―B.J. in The New Order trailer.[src]

    "In my dreams, I smell a barbecue. I see children, a dog, and I see someone. I think I see someone. These things, none of it for me. I move by roarin' engines, among warriors. We come from the night."
    ―B.J.'s dream.[src]

    "Death at the gates again. Howling my name. Can't greet you today. I have a war to win."
    ―B.J. after defeating the planes.[src]

    "Do or die, son. Same as always."
    "Oorah, sir."
    ―Prendergast and B.J. after getting on the plane.[src]

    "It's the break of dawn. July 16, 1946. Everything's gone to shit. The Nazi War Machine is advancing at an astonishing rate. We can't catch up. Our tactics are failing. Outclassed and outgunned, and nobody knows why. People are getting desperate. Not me, I'm here to meet an old friend and settle a score, Turn this thing around."
    ―B.J. on the war.[src]

    "Fergus. What's your status?"
    "Blazkowicz. We've got the skitters in bad ways over here. Trapped inside an aircraft while some kind of armored hell-beast is trying to fucking eat us. No joke."
    "I got the same problem here. Shacked up inside dead wreckage."
    "Is that you over there? Private Wyatt, flash your lights. Blazko, can you see the light? Wyatt, turn off the light. Turn it off!"
    "Yes, Sir!"
    "I see you. What can I do for you?"
    "We can't get to it from our position. Utterly fucking trapped in here. But if you could access the cockpit turret on this here aircraft, you might be able to kill the beast. Regular small arms sure don't work for bugger all. Eh, perhaps, you can swim here? Just keep your head down below the surface and you should be all right."
    "Good plan, Fergus. Coming to you."
    ―B.J., Fergus and Wyatt after the plane crash.[src]

    ―B.J. and Wyatt in Chapter 1.[src]

    ―B.J. after Gates' death.[src]

    "Inhale. Count to four. Exhale."
    ―B.J. on his torture technique.[src]

    "Strange sensation, trapped in my body. I black out, I'm losing time. Sometimes seasons change in the blink of an eye. I'm...having trouble with my thoughts. They dissipate like a scent on the wind...I'm getting better. Because of her. Her name is Anya. She takes good care of me. She takes care of everyone. She holds the place together."
    ―B.J. on the Asylum.[src]

    ―B.J. after killing the soldier in the Asylum.[src]

    ―B.J. falling to the ground and collecting the handgun.[src]

    ―B.J.'s on the Nazis massacre of the patients.[src]

    ―B.J. in Chapter 2.[src]

    ―B.J. after killing all the Nazis.[src]

    "My name is William J. Blazkowicz. Ranger. Army. USA. I'm sorry, my Polish isn't very good. Are you fit to drive?"
    "Where to?"
    "Wherever."
    ―B.J. and Anya leaving the Asylum.[src]

    "And they grieve their dead. Such raw sorrow. Can't partake. Mine would flood oceans. It would drown me. If I let it out."
    ―B.J. on Anya and her grandparents grieving.[src]

    "It's 1960."
    "1960?"
    "Yes. You stayed with us for fourteen years. It's 1960.
    I...I have to find a way to contact the US military. I gotta find my unit, let them know I'm alive and ready for duty."
    "It's no more war."
    "It's over. No more military."
    "The war ain't over. Look at all these Nazis walking around."
    "They won."
    "It's over. The Nazis rule the world now. They are everywhere. Everywhere."
    "What about the US?"
    "The USA, they uhm...What's the word? To surrender?"
    "They surrendered."
    "They surrendered?"
    "Because of the..."
    "Atom bomb."
    "They surrendered 12 years ago. When Nazis atom bombed their country."
    "Well, then I will find the resistance. I'll find them and I'll help them fight."
    "No, no. No more resistance. Everyone is captured. If they live, the Nazis have them. And who can say where they keep them?"
    ―Anya, B.J., Roman and Olenka Targonski on the Nazis' rule.[src]

    "Let me tell you how this is gonna work. I'm gonna ask you one question. You are gonna answer that question in a way that I find satisfactory and if you do not... I will saw your head off with this here appliance, you hear me?"
    ―B.J. Blazkowicz to Keller during an interrogation.[src]

    "Take care of her. We understand each other? Or I will find you and hurt you."
    "I understand."
    ―Roman and B.J. on protecting Anya.[src]

    ―B.J. after getting out of car.[src]

    ―B.J. on Olenka's shooting skills.[src]

    ―B.J. after getting the coffee on the train.[src]

    "William?"

    ―B.J. while having sex with Anya.[src]

    "Steel. Stone. Concrete for miles. I wonder if there's anything in this world worth saving. Desolation. Tyranny. Enemy of endless might. I wonder if I have any friends left standing. It comes down to it, I'll fight alone. But I'll promise you this: friends, if this is where they're keeping you. I will find you, and set you free."
    ―B.J. going to Eisenwald.[src]

    "Wake up. You're dead."
    ―B.J. killing a sleeping soldier in Chapter 4.[src]

    "Gotta be the laziest bunch of guards the world has ever seen."
    ―B.J. before stealth killing the Nazi Commander in Chapter 4.[src]

    "Gosh almighty. I thought I was a goner. And here you are back from the dead ... to save us all, imagine that. What've you been up to, Captain Blazkowicz?"
    "Shooting, stabbing, strangling Nazis. Ready to set things straight, Wyatt."
    "Fantastic. Let's get outta here, shall we? Hey! You, close that door! Alright. Let's get to work."
    ―Wyatt and B.J. after saving the former in Chapter 4 - Eisenwald Prison.[src]

    "Crafty. Loyal. Tenacious."
    ―B.J. to Anya after crashing the car.[src]

    "Fuck me. B.J. Blazkowicz, I should've known. Only you would be dumb enough to do a daytime entry."
    "Caroline. You're alive."If you call shitting in a bag living. Three pulverized vertebrae. You?"
    "Head trauma. Four inches of cast iron shrapnel right in the conk, still in there."

    "Yes, I think so. Perfect. Just gosh-dang perfect."
    "What you got there?"
    "Dog-tags. Wing Commander Fergus Reid of the Royal Air Force. Took those off his dead body, wanted to return them to the RAF, but then there was no RAF."
    "Best damn pilot ever saw and hell of a soldier."
    "I'm not cut out for this, you know?"
    "What?"
    "This, everything. I was 18 years old and suddenly the war was lost. Everything good in the world died, somehow I was the one supposed to pick up the pieces... keep the resistance going, take on the whole gosh-darn Nazi empire. You think I was ready for that kind of responsibility? My ignorance got many good people killed. You remember Private Prendergast? You know that guy, he could survive anything. So tough. Well, I got him killed. Sent him out on a mission and he never came back. I just didn't know any better. Wing Commander Fergus Reid. He would have known what to do. He could have saved so many."
    "I made the wrong choice?"
    "You made a stupid choice! Yes, you did! You left a boy in charge of a man's work. I should have died on that day, Captain, on that slab, and Fergus Reid should have lived. I'm not a child anymore, Captain. I know when mistakes were made. There. Leave me alone now, you here!"
    ―Wyatt to B.J. in Chapter 7 - A Mystery.[src]

    "I made the wrong choice."
    ―B.J. on who he saved in both timelines.[src]

    "Gum? It's good. Cherry."

    ―Fergus and B.J.[src]

    "Found what you were looking for in the archives?"
    "Yup. Got something."
    ―Wyatt and B.J.[src]

    "Like I'm the goddamned errand boy."
    ―B.J. before giving Anya a letter from Set.[src]

    "Human beings. Like 'cattle in this place. Need to stay calm. Remember the mission. Find Set Roth. Count to four. Inhale."
    ―B.J. upon getting his bar code in Camp Belica.[src]

    "The first day is tough, my friend. Learn to accept, it gets no easier."
    "Been here long?"
    Now I can remember no more how many weeks long. Months maybe. Not many survive for long. I was fighting the Nazis in Africa. Held them back for a while. They was too strong. Now I just try to survive. Day for day."
    "I'm looking for a man called Set Roth."
    "I have heard of him. Survived in here longer than any other. He's in block 4. Do you want to go there? You need the right uniform."
    "No talking damn it!"
    "Look for a prisoner over there, by your right, dressed in a Block 4 uniform. His name is Milo. I heard his wife is quartered in our block. Maybe that will convince him to trade uniforms with you. But, you will need to distract the guards first."
    "Thanks."
    ―Bombate meets B.J. as a guard tells him to be quiet.[src]

    "Milo? I know where they keep your wife."
    "What? Who are you?"
    "I'm in the same block as her."
    "You sure? She's not dead? Oh God. She lives."
    "If you're willing to swap uniforms you can find out for yourself."
    "Okay. Hurry."
    ―B.J. and Milo on swapping uniforms.[src]

    "I hope you find what you're looking for, my friend. My name is Bombate."
    "William J. Blazkowicz. Be safe out there."
    ""Safe"."
    ―Bombate and B.J. after he swaps uniforms with Milo.[src]

    "Heard of places like this. Auschwitz. Buchenwald. From east to west."
    ―B.J. upon entering block 4 of Camp Belica.[src]

    "Set Roth?"
    "Look at this Shimshon. So much muscle. A physique wrought for combat."
    "You Set Roth?"
    "I'm not sure yet. What do you know of Seth Roth?"
    "You're Da'at Yichud. Source of the Nazi technology. I'm here to rescue you."
    "You're here to r... This is wonderful, he's here to rescue me. Who will rescue him and them, huh? Get away, Shimshon. Don't waste your time. I swore an oath to never betray the secrets of the Da'at Yichud."
    "Fuck your oath. People are dying. The resistance calls on you."
    "So it's a transaction of sorts, right? My personal freedom for the secrets I swore to keep. Sacrifice my honor on the altar of righteousness, well... Permit me a moment to consider, Shimshon."
    ―B.J. and Set Roth.[src]

    "Here's my proposition to you. Aid me in closing this place down... and I will seat you and your comrades at the table of true power."
    "Deal."
    "I've been working on a little project. That machine there. It moves because of stolen Da'at Yichud technology. I know it very well. Now, this... Don't look at it so bluntly. This. With this I can seize control over that machine. Level the gates of this place. Free everyone. I only miss one more part."
    "Name it."
    It's a power source. Now, that machine... Well, it's electrical systems are powered... by a Detronic battery. You can find a Detronic battery... in the service station at the camp command building. It's in a different block. Block 6. If you can disable the automatic security system monitoring the exits... you'll be able to make into Block 6. I believe that there... at the guards barracks, there's a control module. It controls the security systems. Find a way in. Locate the control module. Disable the systems. Come back to me."
    ―Set Roth and B.J. on shutting down Camp Belica.[src]

    "Oh, God. The stench in here."
    ―B.J. upon entering the guards barracks.[src]

    "There. Done."
    ―B.J. upon killing The Knife.[src]

    "That's gotta be it. Security systems disabled. Need to find Set."
    ―B.J. disabling the security systems.[src]

    "What do you want, Blazkowicz?"
    "Looking for the welder. Have you seen it?"
    "No, I don't think so. Oh, wait a minute, no...You're right, you're right. I was meaning to sort out the railing over by the secret fountain entrance. Fucking thing fell out of my hand into the water. A bit busy at the moment, but... You want the welder, you go right on ahead and start swimming."
    ―Fergus and B.J. on the welder.[src]

    "What's up, Captain?"
    "Looking for the welder. Have you seen it?"
    "Oh, yeah, I...I was attempting to fix the broken railing over by the secret fountain entrance...and I dropped the welder in the water. I haven't gotten around to fishing it out yet. Maybe you could give it a shot?"
    ―Wyatt and B.J. on the welder.[src]

    "All that work for a lousy welder. Next time, you go get it, Fergus."
    ―B.J. after getting the welder and returning to base.[src]

    "Long walk for a lousy welder."
    ―B.J. after returning to the base in Wyatt's Timeline.[src]

    "When I was a kid, the Red Tide was rising. Went into the water on account for disobeying my father. Felt like my skin was on fire, like my skin was on fire."
    ―B.J. recalling his childhood.[src]

    "You all clean? Anyone following you?"
    "No."
    "What do you mean no? Yes?"
    ―Fergus and B.J. on him getting followed in the crate train.[src]

    "Right on time, Captain! Walk in the park, was it?"
    "No."
    "Okay. Well...I'll just get to work."
    ―Wyatt and B.J. after stealing a train.[src]

    "Some backbone on this here magnificent fucking U-Boat captain. I'll give him that. Took the decryption keys to the nuclear cannon to his grave."
    "It won't fire?"
    "Well, not the nuclear warheads, no. And here I was pinning the ram a big proper atom bomb down Deathshead's throat."
    "So let's find decryption keys."
    "Actual physical nuclear decryption keys are not kept on planet earth. They're stored on the Nazi lunar base. U-Boat captains are required to learn them by heart. The Lunar Base is the most secure facility the Nazis have. It's where they do all their top secret research these days."
    "What's your point."
    "Caroline and Anya are working on it back at HQ."
    ―Fergus and B.J. diving down the Atlantic Ocean on getting decryption keys.[src]

    "Had integrity this guy. The U-Boat captain. Paraded to his death rather than surrender his vessel. Took the decryption keys to the nuclear cannon with him."
    "It won't fire?"
    "Normal shells, yes, but not the nuclear warheads. Why won't you talk to us Captain U-Boat? Why so dead? With those keys we could just sail right up to Deathshead. Obliterate the whole compound. End him once and for all."
    "So...Let's get decryption keys."
    "Here's the problem. There are no actual nuclear decryption keys on planet Earth. They're stored at the Nazi lunar base. U-Boat captains must learn them by heart. The lunar base is as secure a facility the Nazis have. It's where they do all their top secret research these days."
    "I'll go to the moon. Never been."
    "Caroline and Anya are putting together a plan back at HQ."
    ―Wyatt and B.J. on the decryption keys.[src]

    "Sweet mother of God. Have you ever seen anything like this? I mean, have you, B.J.?"
    "What the fuck did I just do?
    "I don't know, Captain. Par for the course, ain't it? Mayhem and destruction, like what you always do. It's just you doing you."
    ―B.J. and Fergus on destroying the Gibraltar Bridge.[src]

    "What the fuck did I just do?"
    "We just killed the bridge sir! We just killed the bridge with the big magic metal ball! Oh God! Caroline? We just stopped the train. I'm about to drop off the Captain. He is locked and loaded, good to go!"
    ―B.J. and Wyatt on destroying the bridge.[src]

    "Stupid way to die."
    ―B.J. if he (the player) falls when trying to jump on Fergus/Wyatt's helicopter or fall off the bridge in general.[src]

    "There's Deathshead's chief scientist bound for the Moon. Well, I'm coming for you, you Nazi fuckin' spaceman."
    ―B.J. Blazkowicz[src]

    ―B.J. upon seeing the London Monitor when returning to the Nautica.[src]

    "Berlin. Come in, Berlin. What's your status?"
    "Getting worse. I don't know how much longer we can stick it out. Place is overrun with Deathshead's men. I think their being led by your old friend, Frau Engel. Deathshead's must have promoted her for her actions at the labor camp. Caroline's with me. We've taken cover in the helicopter hangar. Trapped. There are Nazis fucking everywhere. Where the others are, I don't know. Some are dead. Some are hanging on. It's just a matter of time before they find all of us."
    ―B.J. and Fergus on Engel's attack at Kreisau HQ.[src]

    "Come in, Berlin. What's your status?"
    "We're in bad shape, Captain. Hanging on, but don't know for how much longer. Deathshead's men are everywhere. I think your old friend Frau Engel is leading the attack. Deathshead must have promoted her for her actions at the labor camp. Myself and Caroline. We're hiding in the helicopter hangar. Trapped in here. Completely surrounded. Too much chaos. Lost track of the others. They're either dead or they're hiding. They're gonna find all of us. Just a matter of time."
    ―Wyatt to B.J. on Frau Engel's attack on HQ.[src]

    "Not going down. Not yet. Not until she's safe."
    ―B.J. on Anya.[src]

    "We'll get you out of there. We'll go somewhere. I believe there are still places on this earth where people can go. And live happy."
    "I believe so too. But not for me and you."
    ―Anya and B.J. before his final battle with Deathshead.[src]

    "Fergus? You in there?"
    "Blazkowicz. A nightmare this. Trapped in this damned machine. Got no control of my actions. End this. Please. Let me die."
    "I'll see you soon, Fergus. In a better place than this."
    ―B.J. and Fergus at the end of the battle.[src]

    "Wyatt? You in there."
    "Captain. I tried. So sorry I shot at you. I have no control over my actions. Cannot live like this. You have to put an end to it."
    "Private, it was an honor. To serve by your side."
    ―B.J. and Wyatt at the end of the battle.[src]

    "General. Before the day is done. I will have you at the end of my blade. And force your surrender. Crawled down a hole, General? Won't save you. I'm coming for ya."
    ―B.J. before his last battle with Deatshead.[src]

    "Knife's out, time to die."
    ―B.J. on his knife.[src]

    "Fine. I will gut you standing."
    ―B.J. to Deathshead before stabbing him.[src]

    "A mighty woman with a torch, whose flame is the imprisoned lightning, and her name Mother of Exiles. With silent lips "Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free, the wretched refuse of your teeming shore. Send these, the homeless, tempest-tossed, to me..."
    ―B.J. on Anya.[src]

    "Blazko? Do you read? Am I clear to fire?"
    "You're clear."
    ―Fergus and B.J. at the end of The New Order[src]

    "Can you hear me Captain? Am I clear to fire?"

But...I set several traps, I didn't have the time to activate them, but...Look at this. This is a map. For to show you where the traps are. Put them to use on the verkakte faschisten.

    "Is that normal? What Set say?"

    ―B.J. and Fergus on his arm.[src]

    "Nothing in this house but bad memories."
    "So why'd you come? Need a place to hide? You need money? Well, you're barking up the wrong tree, son. Far too late to come begging now."

    "Alright. Who's next?"
    ―B.J. after clearing out the first Commander room in the Manhattan Nuclear Bunker.[src]

    "The only way forward seems to be through that elevator shaft."
    ―B.J. going to the elevator.[src]

    ―B.J. collecting the dossier.[src]

    "Aw, shit."
    ―B.J. upon seeing the robots upon his and Bombate's return to the Eva's Hammer.[src]

    ―B.J. hearing Horton and his group fight.[src]

    ―B.J. to the Panzerhund.[src]

    "Got it. Looks like the Ausmerzer lost track of us. Clear skies on the scope."
    "Frau Engel commands it now... using it to hunt terrorists, but in the way back... the Ausmerzer would roam from city to city. Crushing any resistance. Now, if we ignite a revolt, you can be sure the Ausmerzer swoop in... put an end to it before ye can say Hell's bells. Are we gonna start this revolution... we need to put an end to the Ausmerzer firstly."
    "So, then we mount a surprise attack. Conquer the Ausmerzer, and use it against the Nazis."
    "The Ausmerzer is protected by an automated security system called ODIN. Seen it when I was up there."
    "Well hijack the system. Find the ODIN codes and disable the fucking thing. Yeah, but... That kind of information is a top military secret. Only the Oberkommando is privy to it."
    "Sounds like your basic Nazi military facility INFIL. I'll break into the Oberkommando and steal the information off their, eh... computing macines. Not a problem."
    "Except for the fact that the Oberkommando… is now on fucking planet Venus"
    "Venus?"
    "Ever since you obliterated the Oberkommando at Roswell with the nuclear bloody warhead... the Nazis have been trying to shove the shite back into the horse. So... They moved the Oberkommando to another fucking planet to keep it away from us. All of their top brass, all their top military secrets... have been moved to a fully secured base on Venus. Venus. There is no way you are not making it to Venus, sunshine. I don't care how mighty your arsenal or how much fucking manpower. There is not a hope in hell you can bypass all that security."
    "Yeah... Not with that attitude."
    "Except maybe there is."
    "Whatcha you thinking, Anya?"
    "William and I are going for milkshakes."
    ―Grace, Horton, B.J., Fergus, and Anya on taking over the Ausmerzer.[src]

    "His papers are all in his glove box."
    "Yeah. What about him?"
    "Well, is he a Nazi?"
    "You a Nazi, fella? Can't even tell no more. How I look?"
    "Like a walrus. Don't forget your luggage."
    ―Anya and B.J. after capturing Jules Redfield.[src]

    "Mr. Redfield? Mr. Jules Redfield?"
    "Oh, uh. Yeah, yeah. That's me."
    "I'm Helene. The director of this film. Apologies for the long journey, but... my producer favors a safe location, and has a affinity for dramatic settings. Come"
    "Oh, eh. My, my luggage?"
    "Someone will bring it for you. Come, come."
    ―Helene and Redfield (B.J.) on Venus.[src]

    ―B.J. to Wyatt recovering from his breakdown.[src]

    ―B.J. at the first code console.[src]

    "Wow."
    ―B.J. after seeing Anya kill the Nazis and Panzerhund while topless, pregnant and duel-wielding.[src]

    ―B.J. to Irene Engel before her death.[src]
